1. **Why Do Older Women's Needs Matter?**
- [View the paper](./2021_Why%20Do%20Older%20Women%27s%20Needs%20Matter.pdf)
I finished this paper in the first year in college. This paper analyses the existence and importance of older women’s needs in 
three aspects: older women’s sexual desire, their needs for romantic relationships, and their 
aesthetic needs. It is significant for people to know that older women do have their needs, and 
realize the importance of these needs. In this way, the market can better provide the products 
that meet the needs of older women in the future.
