1. **Why Do Older Women's Needs Matter?**
- [View the paper](./2021_Why%20Do%20Older%20Women%27s%20Needs%20Matter.pdf)
I finished this paper in the first year in college. This paper analyses the existence and importance of older women’s needs in 
three aspects: older women’s sexual desire, their needs for romantic relationships, and their 
aesthetic needs. It is significant for people to know that older women do have their needs, and 
realize the importance of these needs. In this way, the market can better provide the products 
that meet the needs of older women in the future.  

2. **A Reflection on the Transboundary Mothering of Female Domestic Workers**
- [View the paper](./2022_A%20Reflection%20on%20the%20Transboundary%20Mothering%20of%20Female%20Domestic%20Workers.pdf)
This paper serves as a book review and research project in the Gender Matters coourse in my undergraduate study. This book review consists of three parts. Firstly, it overviews the book ***Global 
Cinderellas*** by discussing the structural forces and their cooperation and dynamic 
interactions in shaping global Cinderellas from an intersectional perspective. Then, it 
explores the expected gender roles of the global Cinderellas and how they use the 
intersecting structural forces to bargain with the patriarchy. The last part focuses on 
the discussion of mothering in ***Global Cinderellas***, further interpreting the 
transboundary mothering by comparing a domestic worker in Guangxi province with 
global Cinderellas in the book.
