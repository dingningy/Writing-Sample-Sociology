Apart from consumer behavior and psychological research, I also have a deep interest in exploring the sociology field, especially gender and sexuality studies. This repository includes my selected work from college and master courses.

1. **Why Do Older Women's Needs Matter?**
- [View the paper](./2021_Why%20Do%20Older%20Women%27s%20Needs%20Matter.pdf)
I finished this paper in the first year in college. This paper analyses the existence and importance of older women’s needs in 
three aspects: older women’s sexual desire, their needs for romantic relationships, and their 
aesthetic needs. It is significant for people to know that older women do have their needs, and 
realize the importance of these needs. In this way, the market can better provide the products 
that meet the needs of older women in the future.  

2. **A Reflection on the Transboundary Mothering of Female Domestic Workers**
- [View the paper](./2022_A%20Reflection%20on%20the%20Transboundary%20Mothering%20of%20Female%20Domestic%20Workers.pdf)
This paper serves as a book review and research project in the Gender Matters coourse in my undergraduate study. This book review consists of three parts. Firstly, it overviews the book ***Global 
Cinderellas*** by discussing the structural forces and their cooperation and dynamic 
interactions in shaping global Cinderellas from an intersectional perspective. Then, it 
explores the expected gender roles of the global Cinderellas and how they use the 
intersecting structural forces to bargain with the patriarchy. The last part focuses on 
the discussion of mothering in ***Global Cinderellas***, further interpreting the 
transboundary mothering by comparing a domestic worker in Guangxi province with 
global Cinderellas in the book.

3. **Becoming a Girl or an Elite: Comparing Female Students at St.Paul School with Contemporary Chinese High Schools in Coping with the 'Girl Elite' Paradox**
- [View the paper](./2023_Becoming%20a%20Girl%20or%20an%20Elite_Comparing%20Female%20Students%20at%20St%20Paul%20School%20with%20Contemporary%20Chinese%20High%20Schools%20in%20Coping%20with%20the%20Girl%20Elite%20Paradox.pdf)
This paper is a book review and research project in the sociology course in college. It discusses the transition from elite reproduction to new elite creation in the U.S., highlighting the paradox of democratic inequality. The review focuses on the challenges girls face in acquiring privilege, particularly the 'Girl Elite' paradox, where societal expectations around sexuality limit their social capital compared to boys. It contrasts this with the experiences of Chinese high school girls, who navigate new ideals of femininity amidst neoliberal pressures, emphasizing the shift from 'strong women' to 'excellent beauty' due to social media influence. The analysis includes interviews from Shenzhen College of International Education, revealing varied responses to societal expectations of femininity.

4. **The Social Production of Folk Evils: Revisiting Deviancy Amplification in Crimes**
- [View the paper](./2023_Divancy%20Amplification%20and%20Crimes.pdf)
This paper is a course assignment from the Criminal Justice course in University of Cambridge summer school. The paper first revisits the theory and mechanisms of deviancy amplification. Then, it utilizes 
empirical evidence and cases to illustrate deviancy amplification. Finally, it indicates the limitations 
of deviancy amplification and provides implications for criminal justice.

5. **Queer Media and LGBTQ+ Psychological Well-Being**
- [View the paper](./2025_Queer%20Media%20and%20LGBTQ+%20Wellbeing.pdf)
The study examined queer media characters’ impacts on LGBTQ+ individuals’ psychological well-being through two overarching research questions. The first research question investigated whether there were differences in queer characters’ psychological impacts among LGBTQ+ individuals with different identities. The second research question asked whether queer media consumption patterns, perceived character authenticity, and perceived character intersectionality contribute to different LGBTQ+ identities’ impacts on queer media characters’ psychological impacts. Findings revealed that marginal groups within the LGBTQ+ community, including those
 from developing countries, gender minorities, and racial minorities, reported higher scores about
 queer media characters’ positive impacts on psychological well-being compared to their
 mainstream counterparts. However, in terms of sexual orientation, mainstream groups (i.e., gay
 and lesbian respondents) showed higher scores. Importantly, the study found strong positive
 correlations between authenticity ratings, intersectionality ratings, and scores of queer characters’
 positive impacts on LGBTQ+ individuals’ psychological well-being.
 This study contributes to a more nuanced understanding of LGBTQ+ individuals’ diverse
 needs and experiences with queer media representation, which has significant implications for
 media producers, mental health professionals, and LGBTQ+ advocacy groups in fostering more
 positive and inclusive media representations for the LGBTQ+ community.
